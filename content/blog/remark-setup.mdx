This guide walks you through integrating Remark into your Next.js application. We'll cover everything from initial setup to advanced configuration.

<div className="_spacer mt-8" />
## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a local clone of the application from Github.

<section id="setup-section">
    <div className="fd-steps [&_h3]:fd-step">
          <div className="_spacer mt-8" />
          ### Install Dependencies

          ```npm
          npm install
          ```

          The core packages of the application

          | Package         | Purpose                            |
          | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
          | `convex`        | Real-time database and backend     |
          | `@clerk/nextjs` | Authentication and user management |
          | `@tiptap/react` | Rich text editor                   |
          | `fumadocs`      | MDX processing (for blog)          |

          <div className="_spacer mt-8" />
          ### Initialize Clerk and Convex

          You would need a Convex and Clerk account. Once done, create a new application and get the following API keys.

          Your final `.env.local` should have:
          ```ts
          NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://xxx.convex.cloud

          NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx
          CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx
          CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://xxx.clerk.accounts.dev

          CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
          ```

          ```npm
          npx convex dev
          npx convex deploy
          ```

          <div className="_spacer mt-8" />
          ### Configure Application parameters (optional)

          Centralize your settings in `config/comments.ts`:

          ```typescript
          export const COMMENTS_CONFIG = {
            PAGE_SIZE: 40,
            MAX_COMMENTS_PER_POST: 1200,
            WARNING_THRESHOLD: 0.9,
            ARCHIVE_DISPLAY_THRESHOLD: 500,
            MAX_REPLY_DEPTH: 3,
            MAX_CHARACTERS: 3000,
            DRAFT_SAVE_DELAY: 500,
          } as const;
          ```
    </div>
