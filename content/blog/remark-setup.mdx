          ### Install Dependencies

          ```npm
          npm install
          ```

          The core packages used in the application

          | Package         | Purpose                            |
          | --------------- | ---------------------------------- |
          | `Next.js`       | Frontend                           |
          | `convex`        | Real-time database and backend     |
          | `@clerk/nextjs` | Authentication and user management |
          | `@tiptap/react` | Rich text editor                   |

          <div className="_spacer mt-8" />
          ### Initialize Clerk and Convex

          You will need both a Convex and Clerk account. Once acquired, set up a new application on each platform, then get the following API keys.

          ```txt
          # create a .env.local file and add the following values

          NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://xxx.convex.cloud        # 1
          NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxx          # 2

          CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxx                           # 3
          CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://xxx.clerk.accounts.dev  # 4

          CLERK_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx                         # 5
          ```

          <div className="ml-8">
            - \#1, \#2 are generated automatically when you run `npx convex dev`
            - \#3,\#4 come from your Clerk dashboard. Follow the official docs <Link href="https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/getting-started/quickstart" className="text-primary underline">here</Link>
            - \#5 is for Clerk-Convex webhook, it involves a few extra steps. See instructions below
          </div>

          <Callout type="info"> Don't forget to add `CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL` to your Convex dashboard also. Dashboard  → Settings  → Environment Variables</Callout>

          <div className="_spacer mt-12" />
          ###### Clerk-Convex webhook setup
          1. Go to Clerk Dashboard → Configure → Webhooks
          2. Add a new endpoint URL (this points to a Convex HTTP action from your Convex backend: you'll get that URL from your convex dashboard)
          3. Subscribe to the necessary events, such as `user.created`, `user.updated`, and `user.deleted`. (search for user and check all actions)
          4. Copy the secret key (starting with `whsec_`) to your environment variables.

          <div className="_spacer mt-15" />
          Once everything is configured, initialize Convex:
          ```npm
          npx convex dev # initialize convex
          npx convex deploy # push changes to production instance
          ```

          <div className="_spacer mt-8" />
          ### Configure Application parameters (optional)

          You can update the settings at `@/components/remark/comments/config/comments.ts` to your preference.

          ```typescript
          export const COMMENTS_CONFIG = {
            PAGE_SIZE: 40,
            MAX_COMMENTS_PER_POST: 1200,
            WARNING_THRESHOLD: 0.9,
            ARCHIVE_DISPLAY_THRESHOLD: 500,
            MAX_REPLY_DEPTH: 3,
            MAX_CHARACTERS: 3000,
            DRAFT_SAVE_DELAY: 500,
          } as const;
          ```

          Entry point to the comment application:
          ```tsx
          import CommentSection from "@/components/remark"

          export default function App(){
          return(
            <div>
            {/* customPostId?: string - use this if you want a custom id for a particular instance of the 
                comment-section app, it defaults to the slug of the current page */}
              <CommentSection customPostId="homepage-comments" />
            </div>
          )}
          ```
    </div>

</section>
